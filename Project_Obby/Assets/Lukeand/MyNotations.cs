//can jump. it always jump forward.
//can hold the jump a bit for 



//SECOND
//create spawn point
//create main menu
//create stage system? how does it really work



//7 days of development
//7 of testing and tweaking


//so basically you always just press play.
//and you have a progress level. its always jsut given a new one.
//when you lose something happens
//there is always only one stage but its a very long stage. then we make news ones later?




//TASK
///jetpack - create a double jump.
///mola - jump higher.
//shield - get tank one hit then makes the player immune for a short duration
//there is a timer for each stage to complete.
//getting the movement right.
///certan things can kill the player. but the player has health, then when the player is about to die it can watch an ad to not die but just once.

//STEPS
///i will create the menu first
///then the stage selection and stage systems.
///then i will create the loading into the stage.
///then simulate player losing health and dying.
//then the player winning and going to the next stage.


//SECOND TASK
//the scene system. there are different stages.
///select stage and load.
///ccreate all stages for the palyer to choose
//system of progression
//main menu which you can select play, store, settings, maybe something to watchc an ad
//

//THIRD TASK
//add all the scenees to the game.
//





//player has lives.
//everytime the player is killed it will go back to the next spawn point. 
//this costs a health or the player starts from the beggining. 
//the timer stops while its loading.
//i will load the stage all again for this. but save the last index.


//FOR TOMORROW
//fix the reloading.
//improve the functions for scene transition.
//

//to fix this we will first create a function for each thing.



//i am having problems loading the scene.
///the playerhandler seems to be replicating.
///it is failling to destroy the copy for some reason
///not updating the lives ui
///remove any movement when doing the thing
//the light seems to be different for some reason.

//THEN
///i need to test getting other spawns
///remove prior respawns.
///i need to change the choice of death to ui where the player can make the choice
//if there are no more lifes the player needs to start from the beginning or watch an ad.
//also the player winning and going to the next stage.
//need to load back to menu


//ALSO
///need to change the player being taken to the right positions to a moment where the player is hidden.

//TODAy
///the ability to go to the next stage.
///progress mechanic


//TODAY
//create something about the mainmenu store.
//system for ingame purchases.
//need to make the ad be reward and also called inbetween stages. just the first stage at the first time has no 
//create the timecounter as well.
//save system. 


//i think it only works if i already have the account.


//ALL THINGS NECESSARY TO GET IT DONE.
//progress system <- complete this when we start putting the stages.
///complete shield.
//store but using the ingame currency.
//the bonus in the scene know if you already have it.
//save system (progress, coin,  productsowned)
//create timer. can save that timer in the stage and also spawn timer save.
